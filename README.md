IMPORTANT NOTE: I'VE DECIDED TO ROUND DOWN ALL MY BIRTHDAY ANSWERS. ALTHOUGH THAT MAKES THE CALCULATOR LESS ACCURATE, ITS MORE FOR USERABILITY. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN ASKED YOUR AGE ON EARTH, YOU MIGHT SAY '10' OR '33' AND ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO SAY '10 AND 9 MONTHS' OR '33.75'. THIS CALCULATOR ONLY DEALS WITH WHOLE NUMBER INPUTS.
